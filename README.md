## Description
>*Every programmer had some kind of start.
It happened quite a long time ago.
I was invited for an interview in DevIT.
After passing the interview, my level was insufficient for a full-fledged job.
And I was offered to take a course in the company.
There were some really cool guys there.
And we almost all passed this training course.
For 2 months of training, I have grown a lot as a programmer.
And for this I am very grateful to the company.
This is a wonderful company that gave me a very good start.
The repository includes almost everything we've been through.*
